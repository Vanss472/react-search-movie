## Overview

React Front End Challenge from Significa(Portugal based digital studio) where I have decided to do as my own little project.

**NOTE**: This is not a challenge for an interview. This is me on day 55 of Covid-19 practicing my front end skills. Unfortunetly, Significa don’t hire remote candidates(I'm in the USA).

### **Why Gatsby**

First I was curious to try it out. Read, it have easy set up compare to what I have used in the past (i.e Webpack, Create-React-App).

## Install

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.
